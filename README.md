# OSRS Collection Log Puller

This project aims to provide a convenient way to retrieve the collection log data for an Old School RuneScape (OSRS) player. By inputting a player's RuneScape Name (RSN), the program will connect to the game's API and retrieve the collection log data for that player. It will then connect to a Google Sheet and update the sheet with the items the player has collected.

## How it Works

1. Input the RSN of the player whose collection log data you want to retrieve.
2. The program will connect to the OSRS API and fetch the collection log data for the specified player.
3. It will then connect to a Google Sheet and update the sheet with the collected items.
4. The Google Sheet can be shared with others for collaborative tracking of collection log progress.
